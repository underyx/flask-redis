History
=======

0.3.0 (2016-07-18)
------------------

- **Backwards incompatible:** The ``FlaskRedis.init_app`` method no longer takes
  a ``strict`` parameter. Pass this flag when creating your ``FlaskRedis``
  instance, instead.
- **Backwards incompatible:** The extension will now be registered under the
  (lowercased) config prefix of the instance. The default config prefix is
  ``'REDIS'``, so unless you change that, you can still access the extension via
  ``app.extensions['redis']`` as before.
- **Backwards incompatible:** The default class has been changed to
  ``redis.StrictRedis``. You can switch back to the old ``redis.Redis`` class by
  specifying ``strict=False`` in the ``FlaskRedis`` kwargs.
- You can now pass all supported ``Redis`` keyword arguments (such as
  ``decode_responses``) to ``FlaskRedis`` and they will be correctly passed over
  to the ``redis-py`` instance. Thanks, @giyyapan!
- Usage like ``redis_store['key'] = value``, ``redis_store['key']``, and
  ``del redis_store['key']`` is now supported. Thanks, @ariscn!

0.2.0 (4/15/2015)
-----------------

- Made 0.1.0's deprecation warned changes final

0.1.0 (4/15/2015)
-----------------

- **Deprecation:** Renamed ``flask_redis.Redis`` to ``flask_redis.FlaskRedis``.
  Using the old name still works, but emits a deprecation warning, as it will
  be removed from the next version
- **Deprecation:** Setting a ``REDIS_DATABASE`` (or equivalent) now emits a
  deprecation warning as it will be removed in the version in favor of
  including the database number in ``REDIS_URL`` (or equivalent)
- Added a ``FlaskRedis.from_custom_provider(provider)`` class method for using
  any redis provider class that supports instantiation with a ``from_url``
  class method
- Added a ``strict`` parameter to ``FlaskRedis`` which expects a boolean value
  and allows choosing between using ``redis.StrictRedis`` and ``redis.Redis``
  as the defualt provider.
- Made ``FlaskRedis`` register as a Flask extension through Flask's extension
  API
- Rewrote test suite in py.test
- Got rid of the hacky attribute copying mechanism in favor of using the
  ``__getattr__`` magic method to pass calls to the underlying client
