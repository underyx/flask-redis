History
=======

0.3.0 (unreleased)
-----------------

- **Backwards incompatible:** The ``FlaskRedis.init_app`` method no longer takes a ``strict`` parameter. Pass this flag
  when creating your ``FlaskRedis`` instance, instead.

0.2.0 (4/15/2015)
-----------------

- Made 0.1.0's deprecation warned changes final

0.1.0 (4/15/2015)
-----------------

- **Deprecation:** Renamed ``flask_redis.Redis`` to ``flask_redis.FlaskRedis``.
  Using the old name still works, but emits a deprecation warning, as it will
  be removed from the next version
- **Deprecation:** Setting a ``REDIS_DATABASE`` (or equivalent) now emits a
  deprecation warning as it will be removed in the version in favor of
  including the database number in ``REDIS_URL`` (or equivalent)
- Added a ``FlaskRedis.from_custom_provider(provider)`` class method for using
  any redis provider class that supports instantiation with a ``from_url``
  class method
- Added a ``strict`` parameter to ``FlaskRedis`` which expects a boolean value
  and allows choosing between using ``redis.StrictRedis`` and ``redis.Redis``
  as the defualt provider.
- Made ``FlaskRedis`` register as a Flask extension through Flask's extension
  API
- Rewrote test suite in py.test
- Got rid of the hacky attribute copying mechanism in favor of using the
  ``__getattr__`` magic method to pass calls to the underlying client
