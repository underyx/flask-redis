Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flask-redis

Or if you *must* use easy_install:

.. code-block:: bash

    alias easy_install="pip install $1"
    easy_install flask-redis


Configuration
-------------

Your configuration should be declared within your Flask config. You can declare
via a Redis URL containing the database

.. code-block:: python

    REDIS_URL = "redis://:password@localhost:6379/0"


To create the redis instance within your application

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis

    app = Flask(__name__)
    redis_store = FlaskRedis(app)

or

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis

    redis_store = FlaskRedis()

    def create_app():
        app = Flask(__name__)
        redis_store.init_app(app)
        return app

or perhaps you want to use ``StrictRedis``

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis
    from redis import StrictRedis

    app = Flask(__name__)
    redis_store = FlaskRedis(app, provider=StrictRedis)

or maybe you want to use
`mockredis <https://github.com/locationlabs/mockredis>`_ to make your unit
tests simpler.  As of ``mockredis`` 2.9.0.10, it does not have the ``from_url()``
classmethod that ``FlaskRedis`` depends on, so we wrap it and add our own.

.. code-block:: python


    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.redis import FlaskRedis
    from mockredis import MockRedis

    redis_store = FlaskRedis()

    class MockRedisWrapper(MockRedis):
        '''A wrapper to add the `from_url` classmethod'''
        @classmethod
        def from_url(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            return cls()

    def create_app():
        app = Flask(__name__)
        if app.testing:
            redis_store.init_app(app, provider=MockRedisWrapper)
        else:
            redis_store.init_app(app)
        return app

Usage
-----

``FlaskRedis`` proxies attribute access to an underlying Redis connection. So treat it as if it were a regular ``Redis`` instance.

.. code-block:: python

    from core import redis_store

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return redis_store.get('potato','Not Set')

**Protip:** The `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ package currently holds the 'redis' namespace,
so if you are looking to make use of it, your Redis object shouldn't be named 'redis'.

For detailed instructions regarding the usage of the client, check the `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ documentation.

Advanced features, such as Lua scripting, pipelines and callbacks are detailed within the projects README.
